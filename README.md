- 👋 Hi, I’m @tahaeg1k
- 👀 I’m interested in financial instrument pricing using C++.

Presentation of the project folder+file structure :
- This README gives you a quick presentation of the folder+file structure so that you can navigate around it.
- setup.md : is for setting up the C++ environment to run the project. We advise on having CLion installed from https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=mac . It's efficient, and you can fork directly the project using the "Get from VCS" command on CLion. 
- cmakeintroduction.md : for an introduction the CMake tool for building C++ projects, it's efficient and platform independant.
- options-pricing : project folder that contains the project files.
