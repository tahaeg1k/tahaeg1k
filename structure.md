# This file is for structuring the Project Malliavin project :

Since we are both noobs in Monte Carlo simulations and Malliavin Calculus, we will start from scratch by reinventing the wheel :( .
Ultimately the goal is to get the QuantLib library running on our devices and add a component to it that includes Mallivin calculus, otherwise a simple 
and efficient library is still an acceptable result. 

## First step : European vanilla option pricing with C++ via Monte Carlo methods 

For this first step, we will use the code from the following link : 
https://www.quantstart.com/articles/European-vanilla-option-pricing-with-C-via-Monte-Carlo-methods/ .

The corresponding code will be included in the github.

We can also use https://www.quantstart.com/articles/European-vanilla-option-pricing-with-C-and-analytic-formulae/ for comparing with the analytical formulae.

## Second step :
