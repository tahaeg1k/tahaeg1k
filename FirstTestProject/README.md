# This is a brief presentation to the first test project

Using the following links :

  - https://www.quantstart.com/articles/European-vanilla-option-pricing-with-C-and-analytic-formulae/

We have now a single fail main.cpp which allows us to price a European call and put option using Monte Carlo. 
Analytical solutions are also provided to make sure we obtain the correct results. 

In order to extract the whole project do a pull request.
Also, better to use with CLion IDE.
